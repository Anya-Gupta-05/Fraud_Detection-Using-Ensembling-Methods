# 🔐 Fraud Detection Using Ensembling Methods

## 📌 Overview

Fraudulent transactions are a major challenge in the financial and e-commerce sectors. This project leverages machine learning techniques—particularly **ensemble learning methods**—to accurately identify anomalous patterns that suggest fraud. The goal is to build a robust and scalable fraud detection system that minimizes false positives while ensuring high detection rates.
